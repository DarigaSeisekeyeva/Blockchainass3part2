# UniversityToken Smart Contract - Test Cases
# Overview
This repository contains test examples written in hardhat for an intellectual contract developed in task 3, part 1. The project consists of two main parts:

1. Test examples for the initial version of the smart contract.
2. Test examples for a modified version of an intellectual contract.
   
A smart contract provides a set of functions for managing tokens and other user functions. Test cases guarantee that all the functions of the contract behave both expected, both in its initial form and after modifications.

Tasks
# Test cases for the initial version
Test examples are recorded for the original version of the intellectual contract, covering the following functions:

1. Token transmission
2. Registration of transactions: ensuring that transaction data is registered correctly.
3. Changes in the state: confirmation that the state of the smart contract changes, as expected after each transaction.
   
# Test cases for a modified version
In the modified version of the smart contract:
Initialization of the designer: checking that the contract designer correctly sets the owner’s address.
Turning up tokens: ensuring that the contract gains the specified number of tokens (2000 tokens) for the correct address of the owner after deployment.
